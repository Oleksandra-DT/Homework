	Queen is a British rock band from London, England, formed in 1971 by Brian May, Roger Taylor , John Deacon and Freddie Mercury. They are the second best-selling band of all time, having sold 166.9 million certified records, with sales estimates over 300 million records worldwide. It consisted of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (vocals, lead guitar), John Deacon (bass guitar) and Roger Taylor (vocals, percussion). Queen were originally known as "Smile" a band which consisted of May, Taylor and Tim Staffell. When Freddie Mercury joined and Staffell later left, Mercury convinced Taylor and May to keep going and change the name of the band to "Queen". John Deacon later joined the line-up. In 1975, the band released Bohemian Rhapsody, their first single, which spent nine consecutive weeks on the number-one spot on the charts. It was performed in a ballad style, much like Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven; a style which would later be used in songs by Guns N' Roses (November Rain) and Lynyrd Skynyrd (Free Bird), amongst others. Following the tragic death of Freddie Mercury in 1991 and John Deacon's departure in 1997, the band consists of Brian May and Roger Taylor. They declined being apart of the Queen tribute act, Queen + Paul Rodgers (led by Paul Rodgers of Free and Bad Company), May, Taylor and Deacon all fully support them. </p>
